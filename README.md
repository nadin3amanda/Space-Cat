✨Hey, I’m Nadine! ✨
        I’m a Self-taught/Creative/Aspriring Web/Wordpress Developer/Designer based in the Philippines 🇵🇭.
        I create, modify or redesign websites for clients based on their needs and specifications.
        I also specialize in conceptualizing, drafting, and branding.
        My outlandish working experience for over 12 years in the business process outsourcing industry honed my amazing work ethic, and where I also get to practice contributing my skills.
